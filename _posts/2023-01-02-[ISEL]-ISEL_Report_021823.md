### 22-2 ~ 23-1 Winter Vacation
#### 02/18/2023
These days, I'm feeling humbled. There are several reasons for this:
* My lab mates are more focused on researching then I am.
    * I always had the thought that I was the only person passionate and willingly researching this area.
* Web applications are actually useful to learn.
    * I really hate Web & Mobile applications, but JC told me it makes the process of initializing very simple and concise.
    * Guess it's another example of my stubborness. I don't like to do tasks that are forced/required.
* I used to solve algorithm problems, such as [leetcode] (https://leetcode.com) and [baekjun] (https://www.acmicpc.net). However, lost enthusiasm when I thought I didn't need it since I was planning on to go to a graduate school, instead of getting a job.
    * But I learned it is not only the problem solving, but the grit.
    * Solved the following [problem] (https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1000) using Rust. The reason I chose Rust will be discussed later on(hopefully..).
