"No, I'm just a scared man"

This movie discusses about *fairness* and *rationality*. As it is a short movie, it keeps the audience on the edge the whole time.

The main characters: the old man and GoReng(?), are very unique.
The old man potrays the human instinct and the will to brainwash himself to believe nothing is his fault.
---Spoiler Alert---
Even after he died, he appears as an illusion and continuesto talk with GoReng.
* The quotes in Don Quiote are very powerful and made me want to try reading it.

Wow.. the ending is crazy. Through this movie, I realized what kind of movies I like. Movies with an open-ending + it has to be unexpected.
