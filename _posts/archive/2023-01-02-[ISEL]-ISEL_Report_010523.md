### 22-2 ~ 23-1 Winter Vacation
#### 01/05/2023
Heard from one of my lab mates that keeping track of what you've learned and writing blogs is really important (whether you are aiming for employment of education). Felt more drive when I heard this. Thanks.
Realized I really should keep up with studying research papers.
