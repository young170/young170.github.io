### 22-2 ~ 23-1 Winter Vacation
#### 01/02/2023
After a day in the lab, I went to the study room in Papyrus Hall to do my personal studies. My goal was to study till 23:00. When it was 22:48 I lost concentration and was about to go home (meaning the floor above), but remembered what JC told me.

> *KOR* : 랩실에 나오는 것을 기본 원칙으로 합니다. 혹시 조금이라도 늦거나 일찍 떠나야 한다면, 언제든지 JC에게 알려주세요!! (소통 훈련, 소통할 때 죄송하다 할 필요는 없음.)
(9시 부터 18시까지 자리를 지키는 것을 원칙으로 합니다.)
*ENG* : Showing up should be the number one ruls. If you are going to be late, or have to leave early tell JC!! (Practice communicating, don't say sorry.) (staying from 9 to 6 should be practiced.)

So I tried to focus for 10 more minutes.
It felt really weird, it's just 10 minutes but it felt like a acheived a goal I've set with myself. I was determined to keep my goals.
