### Story

In my elementary school, Central Christian Academy(CCA), there was an art club I really wanted to join. The club was called, "그림드림", which ment DrawDream and also DrawGive. As I look back, I can confidently say this was one of the primary influences of my life.

Starting off with the entrance audition, the participants had to submit a drawing that contained the 3 keywords presented. For example, I heard(and still remember to this day) another group received: horse, rubber band, and box(말, 꿈, 상자). Luckily, mine were easier: bird, dream, and time(새, 꿈, 시간). While I was drawing, I looked back at the table behind me. There were two girls that drew very well. However, the first impression I got when I saw there drawing was, "That's too stereotype". I guess it was about a bird flying through a time-disoriented sky, with clocks that were bending to represent it. I turned back to focus on my drawing, near the end I felt this zoned-out focus. When I was done I knew this was my best, and had no regrets even if I failed to make it into the club.

Conclusively reasoning, the reader of this blog can guess I made it in so I'm going to skip some of the story.

One of the major concepts I learned that changed my life was, "thinking outside the box". I know this may sound too familiar or boring, but it is what it is. At the start I was really rigid-minded. One of the teachers brought a box called, "imagination box". It was a fairly sized box with holes on two sides so that one could insert there hands. When it was my turn, I reached in and felt a squarish bag, and some zippers. Immediately, in my mind the thought that it was a crayon bag settled in. As the other members took their turn and described it, my thought didn't waver. The others all had the similar idea that it was a cover of some sort, I was the only one thinking it was a crayon bag. The embarrassing part was I so sure I started to draw the details.. Think of the embarrassement I had to myself when the answer was revealed!

The other was, not saying "I screwed up"(망쳤다) and not using an eraser. One of the teachers really really emphasized on this. I guess the other members didn't experience the importance of this, but I understood it and am still living it. "I screwed up" or "it's ruined" were the most common phrases you could here when visiting the art room. I believe the words were based on their goal of making a project perfect.
