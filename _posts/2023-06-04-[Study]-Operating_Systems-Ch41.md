### Introduction

This entry contains the notes of ch41 of Operating Systems.

### Getting Started

The original file system structure was very simple and intuitive.

It was composed of a superblock, inodes, and data blocks (you can picture it easily). Personally, it looks like a Pokemon health bar.

However, it was slow.. and made no effort towards preventing fragmentation.

* Amortization
  * Process of reducitn an overhead by doingmore work per overhead paid.
* Parameterization
  * Specific performance parameters of the disk and use those to decide on the exact staggered layout scheme.

### Exercise

1. Think about what data structures must be updated when a file is created.
