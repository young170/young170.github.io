### Introduction
Notes during problem solving.<br>

### Problem Description
Suppose you are given the following code:<br>
```
class FooBar {
    public void foo () {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            print("foo");
        }
    }

    public void bar () {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            print("bar");
        }
    }
}
```
The same instance of `FooBar` will be passed to two different threads:
* thread `A` will call `foo()`, while
* thread `B` will call `bar()`.

Modify the given program to output `"foobar"` `n` times.

### Code
```
typedef struct {
    int n;
    sem_t foo_sem;
    sem_t bar_sem;
    sem_t order_sem;
} FooBar;

FooBar *fooBarCreate (int n) {
    FooBar *obj = (FooBar *) malloc(sizeof(FooBar));
    obj->n = n;

    sem_init(&obj->foo_sem, 0, 0x00);
    sem_init(&obj->bar_sem, 0, 0x00);
    sem_init(&obj->order_sem, -1, 0x00);

    return obj;
}

void foo (FooBar *obj) {
    
    for (int i = 0; i < obj->n; i++) {
        
        // printFoo() outputs "foo". Do not change or remove this line.
        sem_post(&obj->foo_sem);
        sem_wait(&obj->bar_sem);
                printFoo();
            sem_post(&obj->order_sem);
    }
}

void bar (FooBar *obj) {
    
    for (int i = 0; i < obj->n; i++) {
        
        // printBar() outputs "bar". Do not change or remove this line.
        sem_post(&obj->bar_sem);
        sem_wait(&obj->foo_sem);
            sem_wait(&obj->order_sem);
                printBar();
    }
}

void fooBarFree (FooBar *obj) {
   sem_destroy(&obj->foo_sem);
   sem_destroy(&obj->bar_sem);
   sem_destroy(&obj->order_sem); 
   
   free(obj);
}
```

### Solution Explanation
Used semaphores to print one at a time & in a certain order.<br>

### Code Explanation
Each function (`foo()`, `bar()`) `wait`s for each other's semaphore to be `post`ed.<br>
The `post` is given before waiting to prevent [deadlock](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34512/what-is-a-deadlock). Say `bar()` calls `wait` and a context switch happens to `foo()`, which also `wait`s for `bar()`. This causes a deadlock.<br>
However, if the environment is not conducted on a single-core CPU, I guess there won't be a problem.<br>

### Conclusion
I originally tried to go for the [dining philosophers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem), but leetcode didn't support C for the problem.<br>
I solved a few other problems that I didn't post because posting takes a quite of bit of time.<br>
Hopefully I catch up.
