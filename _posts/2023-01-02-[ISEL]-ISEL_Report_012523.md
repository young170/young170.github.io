### 22-2 ~ 23-1 Winter Vacation
#### 01/25/2023
JC told us 3 values a professor is asked time and time again.
1. Research
2. Education
3. Volunteer
First, research is the most obvious one. As a researcher assigned to a university, a professor has the duty to constantly participating in researching.
Second, Education. Professors are priveleged to be able to be part of a university and have the chance to educate. This ties into the third topic nicely..
Third, volunteering to take up positions that are avoided by others show leadership. It is not about the person's personality, the dedication to the community is all that is needed.
